- On a per unit basis or use lease number of rounds ???

### 9.1.1 Airstrike Combat

- LBA or Carrier

### 9.1.2 Surface Combat

- If attacker decides not to conduct, round ends
- Use gunnery

### 9.1.3 Continue or End Combat

- end if defender eliminated, attacker wins
- can continue if: attacker has remaining MPs and defender choose not to retreat
- if attacker choose not to continue, attacker retreats

## 9.2 Combat Resolution

### 9.2.1 Hit Determination

- Add the total attacking Strength values of all  units in the Combat and locate the Column on  the Combat Results Chart that reflects that total. 
- For Airstrike Combat, add up only the Airstrike Strength of units;
- for Surface Combat, add up only the Gunnery Strength of units

### 9.2.2 Airstrike Modifiers

- During Airstrike Combat, adjust the Column used as follows (there are no column shifts during Surface Combat)
- Note that the modifiers below are cumulative.
- Adjustments by Resource Cards (RCs): Use text on the Card
- The enemy has more Aircraft Carriers in this Combat Round: Shift one column to the left.
- The enemy has LBA in this Combat Round: Shift one column to the left.
- When adjusting the hit columns, if the adjustment shifts the column to the left of the 1 Attack Strength Column outside the chart, the attack scores no 
hits.
- If the adjustment shifts the column to the right of the 31+ Attack Strength Column, use the 31+ column to determine hits.
- As mentioned, if there are column shifts to both the left and right, you apply the sum of the column shifts. 

### 9.2.3 Number Of Hits

Roll 1d6 and cross-reference the result with the appropriate column on the Combat Results Chart to determine the number of hits made

### 9.2.4 Hit Allocation TBD

Airstrike Hits
- Attacker allocate hits (9.2.5 para 3)
- The Attacker can select one enemy Naval or LBA unit for each hit scored. 
- If more than one hit is scored, each targeted Naval and LBA unit must have one hit allocated to it, before additional hits can be added to other units
  - e.g. you have 6 hits on 3 naval and 1 LBA units, first 4 hits are on all 4 unit, next 2 hits, one is on Naval the other is LBA

Surface Hits
- Defender allocate hits (9.2.5 para 3)
- The Defender selects which one of his Naval units is hit. Just like with Airstrike Hits, each Naval unit targeted must have one hit allocated to it before a second hit can be allocated to any Naval unit

Hits on LBA
- You can allocate hits to LBA units ONLY during Airstrike Combat (exception: The Bombardment RC (#J07)). 
- Damage to LBA units is not the same as for Naval units; if one hit is scored, an LBA unit reappears the next Turn; if two hits are scored, the LBA unit reappears in two Turns; and so on. If the reappearance Turn exceeds the last Turn of the game, the unit is removed from game. Once damage is fully allocated, apply the damage results as appropriate to the affected LBA unit(s)

### 9.2.5 Damage TBD

- Roll 1d6 for each hit to an enemy Naval unit and add up the total.
- If total > Naval unit’s Defense Strength (DS), the unit is sunk/destroyed and is permanently removed from the game. 

- If total <= unit’s DS, the unit is damaged and reappears in the same amount of Turns as the result of the die roll(s)  total. Place damaged units on the Turn space on the map corresponding with when they reappear. e.g. if 1 is rolled then it appears on the next turn

- If the damage result would place it in a Turn after Turn 5, the unit is instead removed from the game.

- If there are more hits to distribute than units to receive the hits, they must be allocated as uniformly as possible.

- Heavily Armored Ships: EACH hit die roll is reduced by one (-1). If die roll is 1, it becomes zero (0), and the Naval unit is not damaged. However, if a six (6) is rolled, the Naval unit is destroyed, regardless of armor.

LBA Unit Hits: An LBA unit can ONLY be hit during Airstrike Combat, with the exception of the Japanese Resource Card Bombardment (#J07). This RC lets you allocate hits to LBAs during Surface Combat (but ONLY when this RC is In play), so you could technically move a Naval unit group with no Aircraft Carriers to an OZ with enemy LBA without worry.

## 9.3 Combat Resolution

- Attacker resolves combat followed by defender
- Results are simultaneous and losses applied at same time
- some RC events can change sequence of combat resolution

## 9.4 Determine Combat Winner

- if only attacker remains, due to defender elimination or retreat, attacker wins
- attacker units can remain in OZ on complete state or retreat

## 9.5 Retreating

### 9.5.1 Defender Retreat
  - Can choose to retreat before Combat round begins
  - After resolution of combat at 9.1.1 or 9.2.2

### 9.5.2 Attacker Retreat
  - Must retreat if unable to eliminate all Defenders after ALL combat rounds
  - After resolution of combat at 9.1.1 or 9.2.2


### 9.5.3 Retreat Results
  - must retreat ALL units in OZ
  - same as 10.4 Return to Port
    - move to any ports under control
    - NO range limits
    - cannot move through OZ controlled by enemy or OZ in which enemy units are present
      - if not possible use Redeploy of Isolated Units 10.4

- After Combat Round
  - Attacker and/or Defender can choose to retreat
  - Attacher decides first (9.1.2)
  - Defender Retreats
    - LBA removed from map and become next turns reinforcements
    - Unit(s) are NOT flipped to complete state
    - Attacker wins (can opt to retreat)
  - Attacker Retreats
    - See Retreat Results

# 10 Supply Phase

### 10.1 Check Isolation

Japanese Naval and LBA not at Port under friendly control
  && cannot trace a route back to Port under friendly control = Isolated
- Naval: flip to ops complete and redeploy to nearest Port under friendly control
- LBA removed from map and become next turns reinforcement

### 10.2 Port Combat Invasion

20 whole aistrike and/or gunnery points = 1 Ground Strength
1 RC = 1 Ground Strength
Ground Strength >= VP = capture (place control marker)
only LBA and/or RC cannot capture


### 10.3.1 Captured Major Port

Major Ports: Japan, Hawaii, Australia

Japan not under Japanese control - No reinforcements until under control, units under repairs are destroled and removed from game
AU, HI
- repaired units are destroyed
- reinforcements and units undergoing repairs are delayed
- reinforcements arrive in US west coast OZ instead

## 10.4 Redeployment and Return to Port

Redeployment
- LBA move to OZ under their control or OZ with friendly Naval units (TOREMOVE DUPLICATE)
- No need to trace through connecting sea routes
- move only 1 LBA in Strategy Phase (each time you do a redeploy)
- during redeployment phase of Supply Phase, can move all LBA on the map
- From [8.9.3](8.9.3)
  - No distance limit
  - destination OZ, if Base, can only support one LBA; an OZ that already has an LBA present cannot have another one moved there.
  - destination OZ, if Port, can have unlimited LBA
  - The destination OZ MUST be friendly-controlled  OR have friendly Naval units present
- who first ???

Return to Port
- 

## 10.5 Readying Units in Port

# 11 Victory

You can have units in a Port but not have enough Ground Strength to take control of it. In that case, you place a Base marker.

- Controlled Port VP diff, move winner VP up by diff
- Controlled Port and Base number diff, player with more bases gain 1 additional VP
- Also gain VP from RC events

## 11.1 Automatic Victory

### 11.1.1 Capturing Japan

Self explanatory

### 11.1.2 End of Turn 4

- JP have 5 or more VP = JP victory
- AP have 1 or more VP = AP victory

### 11.3.3 End of Turn 5

- AP have 5 or mor = AP victory
- AP has 4 or less = JP victory
